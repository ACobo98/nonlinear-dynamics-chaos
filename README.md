## On deadlines:

The assignment deadlines will be discussed and agreed upon in class. Once fixed, all deadlines are hard deadlines.

## Late assignment policy

- Late assignments accompanied by appropriate justification (e.g. a medical certificate, etc.) will receive no penalisation.

- Late assignments without appropriate justification will receive a penalisation of -1% per late hour.

## Weekly tutoring schedule:

If you have questions on the material, my office hours are:

- On Mondays: 18:00 - 20:00

- On Thursdays: 18:00 - 20:00

## Class attendance:

- You are free to attend or not attend classes. I suggest you should attend all classes.

- All classes will be recorded and posted on Moodle.
